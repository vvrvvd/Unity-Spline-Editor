## Introduction
**Unity Spline Editor** is an open-source tool for creating and managing quadratic bezier curves in Unity Editor. 

The tool has been written to bring editting splines through a separate tool window in Unity. The tool let you do the basic operations like **adding**, **removing** or **splitting** the curve but also provides you with options to **factor**, **simplify**, **draw** or **cast the spline to camera view**. You can also adjust how the spline is displayed in the editor through settings window. 

Although the tool has been built and tested in Unity 2020.2 it should work in the previous versions as well.

## Features

- Creating and managing quadratic bezier splines in Scene View
- Three modes for control points: Free, Aligned and Mirrored
- Separate window for the tool
- Splitting curves by split point value
- Quick factoring and simplifying splines
- Casting splines to either self, custom transform or camera using Physics Raycast
- Casting control points to current mouse position using Physics Raycast
- Drawer tool for drawing splines in Scene View
- Three buttons layouts types: Image, Text and Image & Text
- Adjustable editor settings (colors, sizes etc.)
- Adjustable shortcuts through Unity Shortcuts manager
- Examples with visualizing splines with Line Renderer component

## System Requirements
Unity 2020.2 or newer. It should also work in the previous versions but I haven't tested it yet.
